7-Zip Multi-Part Archive Monitor
Code 
I've created a PowerShell script that continuously monitors for multi-part 7-zip archives. Here's what it does:

Key Features:

Runs Forever: Continuously checks the monitored folder at configurable intervals
Multi-Part Detection: Recognizes common formats (.7z.001, .001, .part1.rar, .z01)
Completeness Check: Waits until all parts are present and file sizes stabilize (not still downloading)
Integrity Testing: Uses 7-Zip's test command to verify archives are working
Parallel Processing: Can check multiple archives simultaneously without blocking
Safe Moving: Only moves archives to "Ready" folder after successful testing
Before Running:

Update the configuration paths at the top:
$monitorPath - where your incoming archives are
$readyPath - where verified archives should go
$sevenZipPath - path to 7z.exe (default is standard installation)
Adjust $checkInterval if you want more/less frequent checks
To Run:

powershell
.\archive-monitor.ps1
The script will create the folders if they don't exist and run continuously until you press Ctrl+C to stop it.
